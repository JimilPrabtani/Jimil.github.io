Designed and deployed Azure Firewall within a virtual network architecture, created custom route tables to force all outbound traffic through the firewall for centralized inspection, and configured Application Rules with whitelist policies. Implemented Network Rules for DNS traffic management and validated security policies through RDP connections and real-time traffic blocking tests. This lab reinforced enterprise-level cloud security concepts critical for securing cloud workloads.",
